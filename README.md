SpreeMenuSuckerfish
===================

This small extension adds existing taxonomies and their root children to the '#main-nav-bar', just after '#home-link'. The dropdown is realized with the famous 'suckerfish' css.

Installation
------------

Add spree_menu_suckerfish to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_menu_suckerfish'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle exec rails g spree_menu_suckerfish:install
```

Customization
-------------

The style of the menu is designed for functionality and the spacing adjusted to work with vanilla Spree 3.6.x. You will definitely have to overwrite a few CSS rules, especially colors and fonts.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. It will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run the specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_menu_suckerfish/factories'
```
